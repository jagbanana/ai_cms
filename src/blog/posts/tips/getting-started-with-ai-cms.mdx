Welcome to AI CMS! Now that you have the system installed, let's get you creating amazing content. This guide will walk you through the essential features and best practices.

## Creating Your First Post

Your blog posts live in `/src/blog/posts/` organized by category. To create a new post:

1. **Choose a category**: `tips`, `guides`, `facts`, or `news`
2. **Create an MDX file**: `your-post-slug.mdx`
3. **Add frontmatter**: Required metadata at the top of your file

<Callout type="info" title="Quick Start">
  Copy an existing post and modify it to get started quickly. All posts use the same structure and frontmatter format.
</Callout>

## Essential Frontmatter Fields

Every post needs this frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "SEO-friendly description (150-160 characters)"
date: 2024-01-15
category: tips  # tips, guides, facts, or news
author: "Your Name"
readingTime: 5  # estimated minutes
image: "/blog-assets/your-image.svg"  # optional
featured: false  # set to true for homepage
---
```

## Writing with MDX

MDX combines Markdown with React components. You can use:

### Standard Markdown
- Headers, lists, links, bold/italic text
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Images and blockquotes

### Custom Components
- `<Callout>` for highlighted content
- `<TableOfContents>` for long posts
- `<ShareButtons>` for social sharing

Example:
```mdx
<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
  This will be displayed as a highlighted warning box.
</Callout>
```

## Organizing Your Content

### Categories
- **Tips**: Quick, actionable advice (3-5 min reads)
- **Guides**: Comprehensive tutorials (10+ min reads)  
- **Facts**: Interesting information and insights
- **News**: Updates and announcements

### File Structure
```
src/blog/posts/
â”œâ”€â”€ tips/

â””â”€â”€ facts/
    â””â”€â”€ interesting-cms-facts.mdx
```

## SEO Optimization Tips

1. **Write compelling titles** (50-60 characters)
2. **Craft meta descriptions** (150-160 characters)
3. **Use descriptive URLs** (your file name becomes the URL)
4. **Structure with headers** (H2, H3 for better readability)
5. **Include relevant keywords** naturally in content

## Content Best Practices

### Writing Style
- Start with a clear introduction
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Include actionable takeaways
- End with a clear conclusion

### Technical Details
- Code blocks are automatically syntax highlighted
- Images are automatically optimized (WebP, responsive)
- Reading time is calculated from your frontmatter
- SEO meta tags are generated automatically

## Publishing Workflow

1. **Create** your MDX file in the appropriate category folder
2. **Test locally** with `npm run dev`
3. **Preview** at `http://localhost:5174/resources`
4. **Build** with `npm run build` to check for errors
5. **Deploy** your changes to production
