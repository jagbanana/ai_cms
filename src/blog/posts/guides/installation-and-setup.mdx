Ready to set up your own AI CMS? This comprehensive guide will take you from cloning the repository to having a fully functional content management system running on your domain.

<TableOfContents />

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** installed on your machine
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- A **code editor** (VS Code recommended)
- Basic familiarity with **command line/terminal**

<Callout type="info" title="New to Development?">
  Don't worry if you're new to this! We'll walk through each step. The AI CMS is designed to be beginner-friendly while still being powerful for advanced users.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, get the AI CMS code on your machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-cms.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ai-cms

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Step 2: Initial Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create your environment file:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your site details:

```env
# Site Information
VITE_SITE_NAME="Your Site Name"
VITE_SITE_URL="https://yoursite.com"
VITE_SITE_DESCRIPTION="Your site description for SEO"

# Contact Information (optional)
VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL="hello@yoursite.com"
VITE_SOCIAL_TWITTER="@yourusername"
VITE_SOCIAL_GITHUB="https://github.com/yourusername"

# Analytics (optional)
VITE_GA_TRACKING_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"
VITE_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN="yoursite.com"

# Feature Flags
VITE_ENABLE_SEARCH="true"
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS="true"
VITE_ENABLE_COMMENTS="false"
```

### Package Configuration

Update `package.json` with your project details:

```json
{
  "name": "your-site-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Your AI-powered content management system",
  "homepage": "https://yoursite.com",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/your-site-name.git"
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Customize Branding

### Site Title and Logo

1. **Update the site title** in `src/components/Layout/Layout.tsx`
2. **Replace the logo** (optional): Add your logo to `public/` and update the header component
3. **Customize colors**: Edit `tailwind.config.js` for your brand colors

### Favicon and Meta Images

Replace these files in the `public/` directory:
- `favicon.ico`
- `apple-touch-icon.png`
- `og-image.png` (for social sharing)

## Step 4: Local Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:5174`

### Development Workflow

1. **Edit content** in `/src/blog/posts/`
2. **See changes** automatically reload in browser
3. **Test features** using the local development server
4. **Check build** with `npm run build` before deploying

<Callout type="warning" title="Port Configuration">
  The dev server runs on port 5174 by default. If this conflicts with other projects, change it in `package.json` under the "dev" script.
</Callout>

## Step 5: Create Your Content

### Remove Example Content

Delete the example posts and create your own:

```bash
# Remove example posts
rm src/blog/posts/tips/getting-started-with-ai-cms.mdx
rm src/blog/posts/guides/complete-customization-guide.mdx
rm src/blog/posts/facts/interesting-cms-facts.mdx
```

### Add Your First Post

Create a new post:

```bash
# Create your first post
touch src/blog/posts/tips/my-first-post.mdx
```

Add content with proper frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: "Welcome to My Site"
description: "My first post with AI CMS"
date: 2024-01-20
category: tips
author: "Your Name"
readingTime: 3
---

Welcome to my new site powered by AI CMS! 

This is my first post, and I'm excited to share content with you.
```

### Update Post Discovery

Edit `src/blog/utils/post-discovery-runtime.ts` to include your new posts instead of the examples.

## Step 6: Build and Test

Before deploying, always test your build:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Preview the built site
npm run preview
```

Check for:
- ✅ No build errors
- ✅ All pages load correctly
- ✅ Images display properly
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ SEO meta tags are correct

## Step 7: Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Connect your GitHub repo** to Vercel
2. **Import project** from GitHub
3. **Configure environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
4. **Deploy** automatically on every push

### Option 2: Netlify

1. **Connect GitHub repository**
2. **Set build command**: `npm run build`
3. **Set publish directory**: `dist`
4. **Add environment variables**
5. **Deploy**

### Option 3: GitHub Pages

Add to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

Deploy:

```bash
npm install -g gh-pages
npm run deploy
```

### Option 4: Manual Upload

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist/` folder to your web server
3. Configure your server to serve the files

## Step 8: Configure Domain and SSL

### Custom Domain

1. **Point your domain** to your hosting provider
2. **Configure DNS** with A records or CNAME
3. **Enable SSL** (usually automatic with modern hosts)
4. **Update environment variables** with your final domain

### SEO Setup

1. **Submit sitemap** to Google Search Console: `yoursite.com/sitemap.xml`
2. **Verify ownership** of your domain
3. **Set up analytics** (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)
4. **Test social sharing** with the meta tags

## Step 9: Ongoing Maintenance

### Content Updates

1. **Add new posts** to `/src/blog/posts/`
2. **Update post discovery** in `post-discovery-runtime.ts`
3. **Test locally** with `npm run dev`
4. **Deploy** via git push (automatic with Vercel/Netlify)

### System Updates

```bash
# Update dependencies periodically
npm update

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix issues
npm audit fix
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails with missing dependencies:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Images not loading:**
- Check file paths in your posts
- Ensure images are in `public/blog-assets/`
- Verify image formats are supported (jpg, png, svg, webp)

**Posts not appearing:**
- Check frontmatter format
- Verify post is added to `post-discovery-runtime.ts`
- Clear browser cache

**Environment variables not working:**
- Ensure variables start with `VITE_`
- Restart dev server after changes
- Check `.env` file is not in `.gitignore`
